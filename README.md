## Recall inverse functions and logarithms

What is meant by y = log<sub>2</sub>x? What does its graph look like?

The mathematical equation y = log<sub>2</sub>x is equivalent to the equation x = 2<sup>y</sup>. In other words, y is the unique number such that when 2 is raised to that power, the resulting number of x. Logarithms is the inverse of exponentiation.
